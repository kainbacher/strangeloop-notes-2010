Open Source Heresy
==================

:author: Douglas Crockford


#. Bombshell #1 - Crockford is a heretic
#. He discovers things

  * Javascript has good parts
  * JSON as good interchange format
  
    * Discovery, not invention
    * Specification & a little website
    * Everything else happened by itself

#. Minimalism

  * The less we have to agree on, the easier it is to interoperate.

#. XML - One tool to rule them all
#. HTML - Always bet on angle brackets
#. Ask not if it is good enough, ask if it can be popular enough.
#. XML is technologically terrible but you have to use it anyway.
#. Disruptions & threats

  * Nobody listens to Dave Winer. :)
  * James Clark - "Any damn fool could produce a better format than XML"

#. Use the right tool for the right job.
#. Where did the idea come from that data should be represented by a 
   documentation format?
  
  * Runoff markup system
  * Then GML (describe parts of the document instead of the formatting)
  * Scribe (Brian Reid)
  
    * First good separation between content & presentation
    * Describes bibliography well (like JSON!)
    * First data in a document format
  
#. JSON Logo

  * Based on impossible torus
  * Hilarious

#. Tilton

  * The ugliest programming language that was not intended to be an ugliest 
    programming language.
  * Based off TV character - speaks in tongues
  * Tilde is an important character

#. json2.js - Mystery Load

  * Onlinebootycall.com
  * Added alert to the top

#. License - MIT

  * Inserted "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil."
  * Occasionally gets emails from evildoers :)

#. JSMin
#. Google's policy protects and promotes evil.
#. Morality

  * Lots of backlash
  * Be allowed to say no.
  * They think he's making fun of their religion.

#. GitHub is *not* an evil organization :)
#. Grace Hopper

  * Gave up the professorship to the Navy
  * First programmer on the Mark I
  * Wrote the manual so others could use it
  * Then UNIVAC I
  * Need better tooling
  * A-0 - the first compiler
  
    * Subroutines, libraries, linker-ish
  
  * A-2 - released to customers (first open source)
  
    * A-3, AT-3, MATH-MATIC
    * Precursor to Fortran

#. Originally no IP

  * Eventually trade secrets, copyright, DRM, patents, etc.
  * Diamond vs. Diehr (1981) - Patent office becomes a revenue generator

#. The Scribe Timebomb

  * Blew up on Richard Stallman after 90 days
  * Led to the open source movement

#. Patents & Openness are exclusive. Close the patent office.

  * Enterprise should rely on their own abilities
  * Useful in the 18th & 19th centuries, but outlived it's usefulness
  * Nobody wins except the lawyers

#. "Everything that can be invented has been invented."

  * Likely no truth.
  * s/invented/patented/

#. IE6 MUST DIE!

  * Netscape set the bar low ("crime against humanity").
  * IE6 was the best for a long time.
  * 10 years old & needs to go.
  * IE7 & IE8 MUST DIE!
  * IE9 ?
