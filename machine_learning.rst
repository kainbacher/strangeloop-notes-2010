#. ML History

  * Eniac
  * Turing Test
  * Eliza
  * AI Winter
  * jmseigler? SexBot (except not)
  * Add stats in the 90's (revitalizes AI)

#. Clustering

  * Start with K-means
  * Entity disambiguation

#. Topic Model

  * R has a topic module
  * Hilary has Python code

#. Recommendations

  * Based on existing data of users with similar interests
  * Amazon
  * Netflix

#. Classification

  * Train the classifiers
  * Bayesian
    
    * Spam Filter
    * Facial Recognition

#. Dirty Hacks

  * Good sources of training data
  
    * Wikipedia
    * NY Times
  
  * lynx --dump <url>

#. How to approach

  * Obtain
  * Scrub
  * Explore
  * Model
  * iNterpret

#. Build a Model

#. Probability Theory

  * Area is 1
  * P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  * Bayes Law

#. Twitter

  * Sports down, Math up
  * Python using NLTK
  * On GitHub

#. Feature Selection

  * Easy for humans, but not statistically feasible
  * Think about what's interesting about the data.
  * (Twitter) N-grams, people, presence of link, etc.

#. Bit.ly

  * Actual a hard problem
  * Size indicators
  * Billions or trillions of data points
  * In memory DB of everything within the last hour
  * Velocity, half-life, prediction
  * Location mining
    
    * Cultural analysis based on when & where people are clicking
    
  * Collaborative Filtering

* Tom Mitchell
* Data Mining (Purple Cover)
* Email for resources

* WordNet

* Research benefits of combining models
