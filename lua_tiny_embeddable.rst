================================================

:author: Kyle Cordes


#. Talk about the Why, not the How.
#. Build in a sandbox
#. Safe by default

  * No IO (without being allowed)
  * Host applications can limit access

#. Small

  * As small as < 100 Kb
  * Easy on small devices or apps.
  * Example: Lua on the iPhone

#. Simple

  * To use
  * To learn, ~20 keywords & ~20 operators
  * To teach

#. Flexible

  * Dynamically typed
  * First class functions
  * Easy interop
  * Written in super-clean C
  * Ample libraries off the shelf

#. Fast

  * LuaJIT almost as fast as C & Java.
  * Faster than Scala/Haskell/etc.

#. Momentum

  * WoW, Garry's Mod, Angry Birds, etc.
  * Large game community
  * 110 games with Lua scripting
  * Lightroom, etc.

#. Is Lua the answer to everything?

  * No but very worth considering.
