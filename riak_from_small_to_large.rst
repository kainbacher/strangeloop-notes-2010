Riak: From Small To Large
=========================

:author: Rusty Klophaus

#. Dynamo-inspired KV, consistent & easy

#. NoSQL

  * More companies, funding, awareness
  * Comcast, Wikia, Joyent (Riak customers)

#. Why?

  * Driven by narcissism, voyeurism & materialism
  * Data generated by humans
  * Constantly connected devices
  * Social Networks (connections that make no sense to computers but make 
    perfect sense to humans)
  * Blob-y, Schema-less, High availability, Capacity

#. Turning Point

  * Scratch an itch -> Build a company

#. Four Important Things

  * Broad Knowledge (Don't make the mistakes of the past)
  * Strong Community (Real problems)
  * Agility (Solve new problems)
  * Restraint (No solution can do everything well)

#. What Characteristics of Riak Important After Different Cluster Sizes?

#. Single Box Riak

  * Might as well use a regular DB
  * Simple KV, Flex Schema
  * Clients in Many Languages
  * Predictable Dev Interface
  
    * Scales up & down well
    * Same interface as a large cluster
  
  * Configurable buckets (like tables-ish)
  
    * Ability to change replication per bucket, write to different drives, etc.
  
  * Links (Lightweight Relations)

#. Small Riak Cluster

  * Parallelism
  
    * Expand the cluster
    * Distributed queries (but act like one)
    * Javascript Map/Reduce
    * Well-Behaved HTTP
    * Full-Text Search
  
  * Power

#. Large Riak Cluster

  * Operations
  
    * No Special Nodes
    * Laugh at machine failure (Replication & Vector Clocks)
    * Scale by adding nodes
    * Packages or Self-Contained Installation
  
#. Plug OSS & Enterprise for 10's of boxes

#. Better off non-virtualized
